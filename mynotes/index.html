        <p> <strong>What is hyperjacking? </strong> Hyperjacking occurs when an attacker hijacks a virtual machine (VM) hypervisor and then uses that VM to launch an attack on other data center devices.</p>
        <p> <strong>Exploit : </strong> 	
            The mechanism that is used to leverage a vulnerability to compromise an asset. Exploits may be remote or local. A remote exploit is one that works over the network without any prior access to the target system. The attacker does not need an account in the end system to exploit the vulnerability. In a local exploit, the threat actor has some type of user or administrative access to the end system. A local exploit does not necessarily mean that the attacker has physical access to the end system.

        <p> 
            <strong>Attack surface : </strong> An attack surface is the total sum of the vulnerabilities in a given system that are accessible to an attacker. The attack surface describes different points where an attacker could get into a system, and where they could get data out of the system. For example, your operating system and web browser could both need security patches. They are each vulnerable to attacks and are exposed on the network or the internet. Together, they create an attack surface that the threat actor can exploit.
        </p>

        <p> <strong>Risk : </strong> The likelihood that a particular threat will exploit a particular vulnerability of an asset and result in an undesirable consequence.</p>
