        <p> <strong>What is hyperjacking? </strong> Hyperjacking occurs when an attacker hijacks a virtual machine (VM)
            hypervisor and then uses that VM to launch an attack on other data center devices.</p>
        <p> <strong>Exploit : </strong>
            The mechanism that is used to leverage a vulnerability to compromise an asset. Exploits may be remote or
            local. A remote exploit is one that works over the network without any prior access to the target system.
            The attacker does not need an account in the end system to exploit the vulnerability. In a local exploit,
            the threat actor has some type of user or administrative access to the end system. A local exploit does not
            necessarily mean that the attacker has physical access to the end system.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Attack surface : </strong> An attack surface is the total sum of the vulnerabilities in a given
            system that are accessible to an attacker. The attack surface describes different points where an attacker
            could get into a system, and where they could get data out of the system. For example, your operating system
            and web browser could both need security patches. They are each vulnerable to attacks and are exposed on the
            network or the internet. Together, they create an attack surface that the threat actor can exploit.
        </p>

        <p> <strong>Risk : </strong> The likelihood that a particular threat will exploit a particular vulnerability of
            an asset and result in an undesirable consequence.</p>

        <p> <strong>Countermeasure : </strong> The actions that are taken to protect assets by mitigating a threat or
            reducing risk.</p>

                            countries in the world participate to some degree in state-sponsored hacking. Depending on a
                            personâ€™s perspective, these are either white hat or black hat hackers.</dd>

                            can also flood a computer or the entire network with traffic until a shutdown occurs because
                            of the overload. A DoS attack can also block traffic, which results in a loss of access to

                            full view of the data inside the packet. Even encapsulated (tunneled) packets can be broken
                            open and read unless they are encrypted and the threat actor does not have access to the
                            key.</dd>
